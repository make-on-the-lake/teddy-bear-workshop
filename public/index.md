# Welcome to Make on the Lake's<br/>{{ site.workshop_name }}

During the Teddy bear workshop we will be augmenting an existing stuffed animal
with animatronics.  We will be using a core micro controller from the good folks
at <a href="https://www.particle.io/" target="_blank">Particle.io</a>.  We're
using this specific micro controller so that we can easily connect our stuffed
animals to <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a>.

## Parts Used

We'll have an assorted selection of stuffed animals for participants to use
(first come first serve).
